<p><a href="https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/W._Jherek_Swanger">W. Jherek Swanger</a> writes in his introduction to Camillo<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">6</a></sup> Agrippa's "A Treatise on the Science of Arms, with a philosophical Dialogue (1553)" that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Scienzia [...] was and is often held to relate only to the study of the eternal: that which exists in nature, or was created by God. Thus theology and astronomy/astrology are held to be sciences. Indeed, Ridolfo Capoferro held that strictly speaking fencing is not a science, but rather an art, because it was not divinely created."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>16th Century Italy asks then if science is concerned only with divine (natural) knowledge<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> and art is the realm of the secular and human-made, then was Leopold Kronecker right when he said<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"God made the integers; all else is the work of man"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The integers look little like the natural world and very much like the simple and powerful abstractions that humans find elegant.
Much to the frustration of the human mind, that which created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig_wasp">fig wasps</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucochloridium_paradoxum">Leucochloridium paradoxum</a>, quantum foam, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid">plasmids</a>, does not create works of abstract simplicity.
If such a divinity left fingerprints in mathematics, that inhuman complexity and irrational strangeness<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">5</a></sup> can be found in the reals but not the integers.
One can imagine the God of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Job">Book of Job</a> creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2">the square root of two</a> and pi, but not additive groups.</p>
<p>I have an imperfect rule of thumb for determining if something is of human construction or for the purposes of this exploration, divine.
If the something under examination causes a sense of existential nausea, disorientation, and a deep sense that is can't possibly work like that, it is divine<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>.
If on the other hand it feels universal, simple, and ideal, it is the product of human effort.</p>
<h2>The Hierarchy of Weirdness</h2>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/details/kodokan-judo/page/124"><img alt="triangle choke (sankaku-jime) from Kodokan Judo ny Jigoro Kano - edited by Kodokan Editorial Committee (1986)" src="figs/trianglejudo.png" /></a></p>
<p>This is an overly simplistic classification.
Humans are part of the universe, so when humans create something, the created thing is contained, and is a function of, what already exists, e.g. the triangle choke (sankaku-jime) only works because humans have arms and legs.
It wouldn't be meaningful to talk about this triangle choke in a universe without life, arms, or legs.</p>
<p>More specifically, we can define a hierarchy of creation, or what a 16th Century Italian would call divine creation.
At the top of the hierarchy of reality we have eternal nature. Eternal nature gives rise to emergent nature, which in turn gives rise to humans, which gives rise to human ideas.
As shown below, the closer we get to eternal nature the greater the weirdness (from a human perspective).</p>
<p><img alt="hierarchy of weirdness" src="figs/creationheirarchy.png" /></p>
<p>The real numbers are much closer to eternal nature<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>, whereas the integers are much closer to human ideas.
This is why to human mind the integers feel more perfect, feel more divine.
A hammer feels like the perfect tool to hammer a nail not because a hammer is closer to eternal nature or more divine, but because it isn't divine.
Hammers feel like the perfect tool because they were invented by humans specifically to solve the human problem of hammering nails.</p>
<h2>Kronecker, Cantor and God</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_paradise">"From the paradise that Cantor created for us no-one shall be able to expel us."</a> David Hilbert (1926)<sup id="fnref:12"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:12">10</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kronecker's quote about the integers being divine was not made so much because Kronecker because he wanted to elevate the reputation of the integers but because he wanted to damn infinity.
It was made in the context his campaign against infinity in Mathematics and one of the main targets of this war was Cantor's transfinites<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">7</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Cantor's ideas also sparked a theological debate since if the mind can reason about infinity, perhaps the mind can also reason about God[9].
Cantor himself was deeply invested in the theological implications of his Mathematical work. He believed that God was beyond the mind and thus his Mathematical work was not the result of his own effort but rather God was speaking through him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Transfinite with its abundance of formations and forms, points with necessity to an Absolute, to the “truly Infinite”, to whose Magnitude nothing can be added or subtracted and which therefore is to be seen quantitatively as absolute Maximum. The latter exceeds, so to speak, the human power of comprehension and eludes particularly mathematical determination; whereas the Transfinite not only fills the vast field of the possible in God’s knowledge, but also offers a rich, constantly increasing field of ideal inquiry and attains reality and existence, I am convinced, also in the world of the created, up to a certain degree and in different relations, to bring the Magnificence of the Creator, following His absolute free decree, to greater expression than could have occurred through a merely "finite world"."  - <a href="https://jamesrmeyer.com/infinite/cantor-religion-transfinite">From a letter from Georg Cantor to A. Eulenberg, Feb. 28, 1886, as in Gesammelte Abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen Inhalts, Georg Cantor, ed by Ernst Zermelo, Springer-Verlag, 2013, translation by Gabriele Chaitkin in On the Theory of the Transfinite.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use the word weirdness above rather than complexity because what matters is the strangeness of eternal nature to human thought, it need not be more complex and could in fact be simpler than many things we consider normal like pants or a traffic jam.
Maybe it isn't the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps">God of the gaps</a>, but rather than the gaps are the God<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">9</a></sup>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The whole secret of mysticism is this: that man can understand everything by the help of what he does not understand. The morbid logician seeks to make everything lucid, and succeeds in making everything mysterious. The mystic allows one thing to be mysterious, and everything else becomes lucid" - <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16769/16769-h/16769-h.htm">ORTHODOXY by G. K. CHESTERTON (1908)</a></p>

<p>We can ignore the question of the existence of God since by "divine" here we mean that which does not depend on us. Or in more modern atheistic terms, we are talking about nature and what if anything is prior to nature.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>We don't have Leopold Kronecker actual words. Heinrich Weber wrote in a 1893 issue of <a href="https://archive.org/stream/sim_mathematische-annalen_1893_43/sim_mathematische-annalen_1893_43_djvu.txt">the journal Mathematische Annalen 43(1)</a> that Kronecker at a 1886 lecture made the statement: "Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk" (translated: "God made the integers; all else is the work of man"). <br><br>
The full context in German is: "Eine wesentliche Liicke wiirde aber in dem Bilde des Mathematikers Kronecker bleiben, wenn ich seine Stellung zu den fundamentalen, philosophischen Fragen der Mathematik mit Stillschweigen iibergehen wollte. Es ist ein Standpunkt, der besonders in seinen spiteren Jahren hervortrat, vielleicht mehr noch im persénlichen Verkehr als in der Oeffentlichkeit; aber auch 6ffentlich hat er seine Anschauungen nicht verleugnet und z. B. in der Festschrift zu Zeller’s Jubiléum scharf hervorgekehrt. <br>
In Bezug auf Strenge der Begriffe stellt er die héchsten An-forderungen und sucht alles, was Biirgerrecht in der Mathematik haben soll, in die krystallklare eckige Form der Zahlentheorie zu zwingen. <br>
Manche von Ihnen werden sich des Ausspruchs erinnern, den er in einem Vortrag bei der Berliner Naturforscher- Versammlung im Jahre 1886 that: ,,Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk“.<br>
So war ihm alles, was sich nicht eines arithmetischen Ursprungs unmittelbar bewusst war, unsympathisch, und sein Streben ging dahin, nicht nur in der Algebra, sondern auch in der Functionentheorie die arithmetische Abstammung deutlich hervortreten zu lassen."<br><br>
Translated via google into english: "However, a significant gap would remain in the picture of Kronecker as a mathematician if I were to ignore his position on the fundamental, philosophical questions of mathematics. It is a standpoint that became particularly prominent in his later years, perhaps more so in personal interaction than in public; but even publicly, he did not deny his views and, for example, sharply emphasized them in the Festschrift for Zeller's anniversary.<br>
Regarding conceptual rigor, he sets the highest standards and seeks to force everything that should have a civil right in mathematics into the crystal-clear, angular form of number theory.
Some of you will recall the statement he made in a lecture at the Berlin Natural Scientists' Meeting in 1886: "The good Lord created the integers; everything else is the work of man."<br>
Thus, he disliked anything that was not directly conscious of an arithmetic origin, and his aim was to make the arithmetic origin clearly evident not only in algebra but also in function theory."<br>&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>One could argue that integers exist in the same way that the reals do and therefore at both eternal nature. This seems impossible to dispute because the reals contain the integers, so if the reals are eternal nature, integers contained in the reals must be as well. My argument is that the human invention of the integers, is not the integers themselves but the idea of the integers as a thing that exists separate from the reals. Mathematical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Platonism">Platonism</a> does not prevent human invention in Mathematics. Anyone who wants to argue this point should present an argument for the concept of <a href="https://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/baker%27s_dozen#:~:text=baker's%20dozens">"a bakers dozen"</a> is not of human invention.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>"[Gutberlet] had responded by seizing upon Cantor's Mathematical work to argue that it provided clear evidence that the human mind could contemplate the actual infinite. Moreover, it if did so, it would get closer to the true nature of the divine. The collection of divine thoughts in the mind of an unchanging, he argument must comprise a complete and infinite set.

<p>I always find the argument about the God of the gaps bizarre, because the more knowledge about reality we gain, the greater the number and size of gaps. Once you add Godel to the picture, this gap is ever widening. I don't know what sort of conclusion to draw from all of this. This is somewhat of strange essay and not the sort of thing I typically write.
