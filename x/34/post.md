[W. Jherek Swanger](https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/W._Jherek_Swanger) writes in his introduction to Camillo Agrippa's "A Treatise on the Science of Arms, with a philosophical Dialogue (1553)" that:

> "Scienzia [...] was and is often held to relate only to the study of the eternal: that which exists in nature, or was created by God. Thus theology and astronomy/astrology are held to be sciences. Indeed, Ridolfo Capoferro held that strictly speaking fencing is not a science, but rather an art, because it was not divinely created."

16th C Italy asks then if science is concerned only with divine (natural) knowledge[^1] and art is the realm of the secular and human-made, then was Leopold Kronecker right when he said[^2]:

> "God made the integers; all else is the work of man"

The integers look little like the natural world and very much like the simple and powerful abstractions that humans find elegant.
Much to the frustration of the human mind, that which created [fig wasps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fig_wasp), [Leucochloridium paradoxum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucochloridium_paradoxum), quantum foam, and [plasmids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmid), does not create works of abstract simplicity.
If such a divinity left fingerprints in mathematics, that inhuman complexity and irrational strangeness can be found in the reals but not the integers.
One can imagine the God of the [Book of Job](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Job) creating [the square root of two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root_of_2) and pi, but not additive groups.

I have an imperfect rule of thumb for determining if something is of human construction or for the purposes of this exploration divine.
If the something under examination causes a sense of existential nausea, disorientation and a deep sense that is can't possibly work like that, it is divine[^3].
If on the other hand it feels universal, simple and ideal, it is the product of human effort.

[^1]: We can ignore the question of the existence of God since divine here is that which does not depend on us. That is, nature and what if anything is prior to nature.

[^2]: We don't have Leopold Kronecker actual words. Heinrich Weber wrote in a 1893 issue of [the journal Mathematische Annalen 43(1)](https://archive.org/stream/sim_mathematische-annalen_1893_43/sim_mathematische-annalen_1893_43_djvu.txt) that Kronecker at a 1886 lecture made the statement: "Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk" (translated: "God made the integers; all else is the work of man"). <br><br>
The full context in German is: "Eine wesentliche Liicke wiirde aber in dem Bilde des Mathematikers Kronecker bleiben, wenn ich seine Stellung zu den fundamentalen, philosophischen Fragen der Mathematik mit Stillschweigen iibergehen wollte. Es ist ein Standpunkt, der besonders in seinen spiteren Jahren hervortrat, vielleicht mehr noch im persénlichen Verkehr als in der Oeffentlichkeit; aber auch 6ffentlich hat er seine Anschauungen nicht verleugnet und z. B. in der Festschrift zu Zeller’s Jubiléum scharf hervorgekehrt. <br>
In Bezug auf Strenge der Begriffe stellt er die héchsten An-forderungen und sucht alles, was Biirgerrecht in der Mathematik haben soll, in die krystallklare eckige Form der Zahlentheorie zu zwingen. <br>
Manche von Ihnen werden sich des Ausspruchs erinnern, den er in einem Vortrag bei der Berliner Naturforscher- Versammlung im Jahre 1886 that: ,,Die ganzen Zahlen hat der liebe Gott gemacht, alles andere ist Menschenwerk“.<br>
So war ihm alles, was sich nicht eines arithmetischen Ursprungs unmittelbar bewusst war, unsympathisch, und sein Streben ging dahin, nicht nur in der Algebra, sondern auch in der Functionentheorie die arithmetische Abstammung deutlich hervortreten zu lassen."<br><br>
Translated via google into english: "However, a significant gap would remain in the picture of Kronecker as a mathematician if I were to ignore his position on the fundamental, philosophical questions of mathematics. It is a standpoint that became particularly prominent in his later years, perhaps more so in personal interaction than in public; but even publicly, he did not deny his views and, for example, sharply emphasized them in the Festschrift for Zeller's anniversary.<br>
Regarding conceptual rigor, he sets the highest standards and seeks to force everything that should have a civil right in mathematics into the crystal-clear, angular form of number theory.
Some of you will recall the statement he made in a lecture at the Berlin Natural Scientists' Meeting in 1886: "The good Lord created the integers; everything else is the work of man."<br>
Thus, he disliked anything that was not directly conscious of an arithmetic origin, and his aim was to make the arithmetic origin clearly evident not only in algebra but also in function theory."<br>
