A few months ago I got to debug and [fix](https://github.com/darrenstarr/VtNetCore/pull/14) an interesting bug in the Csharp virtual terminal library [VtNetCore](https://github.com/darrenstarr/VtNetCore).
We use VtNetCore at [BastionZero](https://bastionzero.com) to extract terminal commands in realtime from user terminal sessions as they flow over the wire. This requires feeding the standard out and standard err of a terminal session into VtNetCore and then detecting when a user has entered a command and finding for the command in the rendered screen buffer of VtNetCore. We begin noticing that sometimes commands would stop being extracted from a session and that after this the command extraction thread would starting taking increasing long times to finish.
