<h1>A Response to Wertheimer's 'Encryption and the NSA Role in International Standards'.</h1><p>01-14-2015 6:43PM ET </p><hr /><p><strong>Update 3:</strong>
Our response has been published in the Notices of the AMS as <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201506/rnoti-p613.pdf">a letter to the editor</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong>
Peter Woit has <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=7457">written a blog post reacting to Dr. Wertheimer's letter in the AMS</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Matthew Green has just written <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2015/01/hopefully-last-post-ill-ever-write-on.html">a response to Dr. Wertheimer letter</a>.</p>
<p>In a recent letter to the American Mathematical Society titled <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201502/rnoti-p165.pdf">'Encryption and the NSA Role in International Standards'</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wertheimer">Dr. Wertheimer</a>, a former NSA Mathematician and Research Directer, works very hard to leave the impression that the NSA did not place a backdoor in the <a href="http://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2013/09/the-many-flaws-of-dualecdrbg.html">DUAL_EC_DRBG algorithm</a>. He never directly says that though because the evidence is so overwhelming to the contrary. Instead he chooses to engage in what can only be called aggressive and willfully misleading:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He produces a history of the development of DUAL_EC_DRBG that neglects any facts about the NSA designing it for the purposes of subverting encryption. He does not mention what internal NSA documents called “a challenge in finesse” to get NIST to accept it<sup id="fnref:0"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:0">1</a></sup>.<br />
To further his deception he never once mentions the overwhelming public evidence provided by Snowden that DUAL EC was intentionally backdoored by the NSA<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>. He mentions nothing about the 10 million dollars the NSA paid to have RSA make the backdoored algorithm, DUAL_EC_DRBG, the default in RSA's library<sup id="fnref:10"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:10">11</a></sup>.
Are such <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie#Lying_by_omission">"sins of omission"</a> acceptable behavior by a mathematician in a mathematical publication<sup id="fnref:11"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:11">12</a></sup>? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He suggests strongly, but never says, that the NSA does not backdoor encryption, <a href="http://ethanheilman.tumblr.com/post/70646748808/a-brief-history-of-nsa-backdoors">which we know to be false</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The most problematic is the statement that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[..] we realize that our advocacy for the DUAL_EC_DRBG casts suspicion on the broader body of work NSA has done to promote secure standards. Indeed, some colleagues have extrapolated this single action to allege that NSA has a broader agenda to “undermine Internet encryption.” A fair reading of our track record speaks otherwise." - <a href="http://www.ams.org/notices/201502/rnoti-p165.pdf">'Encryption and the NSA Role in International Standards'</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A "fair reading" is a very strange test, but the NSA's advocacy for controlling cryptographic research, subverting internet encryption and sabotaging standards speaks quite clearly towards its broad agenda.</p>
<p>The NSA's own history talks about shortening the DES key length so they could break it<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">3</a></sup>. That is, the NSA willfully created insecure standards. This takes place with the backdrop of the NSA's earlier blacklisting of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Feistel">Feistel</a> (the inventor of DES) so he couldn't find employment researching block ciphers<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">4</a></sup>. </p>
<p>ProPublica quotes an NSA document 'One goal in the agency’s 2013 budget request was to “influence policies, standards and specifications for commercial public key technologies,"'<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">7</a></sup> for the purposes of exploitation. In that same document the NSA discusses their successes in backdooring web and VPN encryption hardware to gain further exploitation capabilities<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>The NSA's own leaked documents clearly shows a broad agenda of undermining internet encryption.  Dr. Wertheimer, as both a former Technical Director of NSA’s Signals Intelligence Directorate and former Director of Research at NSA<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">8</a></sup>, must know this.</p>
<p>He concludes his letter with:</p>
<p>"During those formative years I had many opportunities to present results at AMS conferences, and I remember the warm embrace of colleagues who encouraged and supported my studies. I felt then, and I feel now, a connection to the mathematics community that goes beyond scholarship."</p>
<p>He is trying to make fools of that same community which showed him such warmth and friendship. This lack of respect and forthrightness to a community which nurtured him saddens me<sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8">9</a></sup>. It shows how the NSA's relationship with the Mathematical community is morally corrosive. 
It turns colleagues, friends and communities into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick#Terminology">marks</a><sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9">10</a></sup>.</p>
